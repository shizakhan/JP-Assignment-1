        <p style="font-family:Arial ;"> My name is <b>Shiza Khan</b>, and I proudly embrace Islam as my religion. Residing in the vibrant city of Karachi, I've cultivated a deep appreciation for its rich culture and diverse community.
            Armed with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and innovate for a better tomorrow. Beyond academia, I find joy in exploring the intricacies of life, indulging in creative pursuits, and nurturing meaningful connections with those around me. 
            As I navigate through the complexities of existence, I strive to embody the values of kindness, perseverance, and integrity, guided by the teachings of Islam and a commitment to personal growth.

                I really enjoy three things: traveling, sports, and cooking. When I travel, I get to see new places and learn about different cultures, which is super exciting. Playing sports is also a big part of my life because it's fun and keeps me active. 
                I love the thrill of competing and the feeling of teamwork. Cooking is another hobby I love because it lets me be creative and make yummy food for myself and others. Overall, these hobbies make me happy and add lots of fun to my life.
